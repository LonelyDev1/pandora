Pandora | Interactive Telnet Honeypot

Preface:
  Since the propagation of IoT Malwares in 2016 there have been more and more threat actors looking to find and infect vulnerable telnet devices. 
  There are also a lot of honeypots that was designed and engineered to capture these threat actors, and to be able to understand their behavior and motives.
  What makes Pandora different from these telnet honeypots? Pandora is a straight forward code and very light weight. There is not much needed to learn to be
  able to setup the honeypot environment.

Pandora is in it's early development stages and over time we will continue to update the code with new features but it would still remain very straight forward and easy to use.
